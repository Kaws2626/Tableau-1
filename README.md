<h1>Kaws - Visualisations</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on analyzing supplier performance and identifying opportunities to reduce overall procurement costs for loss making products. The goal was to help the company make data-driven decisions when negotiating supplier contracts, consolidating purchases, and optimizing order quantities. Insights from the analysis (simple screenshots) led to the identification of high-cost suppliers and potential savings through vendor consolidation.
